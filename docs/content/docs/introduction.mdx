Buttery Auth is a framework-agnostic authentication and authorization framework for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenancy, multi-session support, or even enterprise features like SSO, it lets you focus on building your application instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Why Buttery Auth?

*Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem has long been a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication features. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do buttery as a communityâ€”hence, Buttery Auth.*

## Features

Buttery Auth aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the features:
